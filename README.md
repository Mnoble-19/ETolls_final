This is the Repository for Group 2 recess project of building a mobile application.
The application was developed by Group 2 computer science using the Flutter mobile framework in Dart language.
E-Tolls is an application developed to simplify the process of payment of tolls for the UNRA EXpress Highway. 
This, we believe will help reduce queues at the toll gates of the highway.
